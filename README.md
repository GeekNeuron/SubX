# üöÄ SubX - Galactic Subtitle Editor üå†

Welcome, intrepid time-traveler and linguist, to SubX! Your all-in-one, offline-first, browser-based command center for conquering the cosmos of SRT subtitle files. Prepare to bend time, translate across galaxies, and ensure every word aligns perfectly with the visual wonders of your moving pictures.

## ‚ú® Features from Across the Universe

SubX is packed with stellar features to make your subtitle editing journey smooth and efficient:

* **Universal SRT Compatibility:**
    * **File Upload:** Drag & drop your `.srt` scrolls or use the `Ctrl+O` portal to summon them.
    * **Multi-Encoding Support:** Deciphers various ancient encodings (UTF-8, Windows-1256, Windows-1252, etc.) so no dialect is lost in translation.
    * **SRT Parsing & Display:** Intelligently parses and displays subtitles in a clear, tabular format: Line No., Start Time, End Time, Text.
* **Precision Editing Tools:**
    * **Direct In-Table Editing:** Modify start/end times and text directly within the data grid.
    * **Add & Delete:** Effortlessly create new subtitle entries or banish unwanted ones (single or `Ctrl+D` for active row).
    * **Save As .srt:** Export your masterpiece back into the universal SRT format (`Ctrl+S`).
* **Advanced Chronomancy (Time Manipulation):**
    * **Global Shift:** Shift all subtitles forward or backward in time with millisecond precision.
    * **Selected Shift:** Apply time shifts only to your chosen subtitle entries.
    * **Set Duration:** Directly define the display duration for selected subtitles.
    * **Two-Point Synchronization:** A powerful chronometer to linearly adjust subtitle timings based on two reference points from your source video and current SRT. Perfect for correcting temporal drifts or scaling issues across entire timelines.

    * **Merge with Next:** Combine a subtitle with the one immediately following it (`Ctrl+Shift+M` on active row).
* **Quality Assurance (Error Checking & Correction):**
    * **Automated Error Detection:** Identifies common temporal and textual anomalies:
        * Overlapping subtitles.
        * Durations that are too short or too long.
        * Excessive lines per subtitle.

    * **Automated Fixes:** Attempt to auto-correct overlaps and duration issues.

## üåå Setting Up Your Local SubX Instance (For Developers)

While SubX is designed for direct browser use, if you wish to tinker with its core mechanics:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/subx.git](https://github.com/your-username/subx.git)
    cd subx
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install 
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Launch the Development Server:**

    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This will typically open SubX in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
